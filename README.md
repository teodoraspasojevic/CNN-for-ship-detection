# CNN-for-ship-detection
Using Convolution Neural Networks for detecting ships on images.

The dataset used in project consists of images extracted from satellite imagery in the San Francisco Bay area and San Pedro Bay, California. We created a convolutional neural network that recognizes a ship on the given image. Created neural network has total number of 62530 parameters, input layer, few convolutional layers, MaxPooling and Dropout layers and final output layer. Project also includes solutions for preventing the overfitting and different ways of balancing the classes.

Please refer to Project Report.pdf for detailed explanation of the architecture of CNN and implemented balancing and fine-tuning methods.
